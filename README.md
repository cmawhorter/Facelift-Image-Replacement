# Facelift-Image-Replacement
Facelift Image Replacement (or FLIR, pronounced fleer) is an image replacement script that dynamically generates image representations of text on your web page in fonts that otherwise might not be visible to your visitors. The generated image will be automatically inserted into your web page via Javascript and visible to all modern browsers. Any element with text can be replaced: from headers (&lt;h1>, &lt;h2>, etc.) to &lt;span> elements and everything in between!

Update: I obviously never uploaded the code and have since lost it.  Luckily, someone else was nice enough to archive it here: https://github.com/amclin/facelift
